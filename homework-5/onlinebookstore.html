    <h1>Online Bookstore</h1>

    <p>
      You have been hired by a local bookstore to develop an online
      ordering system for customers. The bookstore only has certain books
      available through this service: Hop on Pop, Fox in Socks, The Cat in the
      Hat, and A Fly Went By. You must show all of the available books and give
      customers a way to add them to the cart. Show the customers their cart and
      allow them to remove the last item they added.
