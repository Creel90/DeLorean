### Key Takeaways (Analyst)

The most important new topics covered in this week's assignment are event listeners and functions. Event listeners are triggered by a user on the webpage when interacting with elements, such as clicking a button (`onClick`) or mousing over an input field or text (`onFocus`). Event listeners are often used when creating logic to change something on the webpage after the user triggers them. Functions are an aspect of JavaScript that runs the contained lines of code, and can be reused in any other part of the file. Parameters can optionally be passed to functions to retrieve or manipulate their data.

Additional topics include conditionals and array methods. Conditionals are a way to control the flow of logic, and include `if`, `else`, and `switch`. `if` checks if a condition is true or not (a boolean value), while an `else` runs only if the previous `if` condition failed. `switch` is unique in that it breaks one value into several `case` statements that will only run if the  given value matches exactly with that of the `case`.  Array methods are ways to manipulate the contents of array: `push` inserts a new element into the end of an array, while `pop` removes the last element. `unshift` and `shift` work similarly, but involve the first element instead.

### Core Webpages (Architect)

- Online Bookstore - Users can browse book list and add or remove books from their carts. Provides a message in the cart saying "No books in cart".

- Flower Shop - Displays a list of flowers for users to add to their carts as well as a way to remove the last item they added to the cart. If no books are in the cart it displays the message "No flowers in cart".

- Restaurant Menu -

- Animal Shelter -
