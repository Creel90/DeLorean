            <p>Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to Earth, located about 4.37 light-years away. It’s actually a triple star system made up of Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. The first two are similar to our Sun and orbit each other, while Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf and the closest of the three to Earth. Proxima even has at least one planet that may lie in the habitable zone!</p>
