            <h2>Alpha centauri</h2>
            <img src="Images-Stars/Unknown.jpeg"alt="Alpha centauri">
            <p>Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to Earth, located about 4.37 light-years away. It’s actually a triple star system made up of Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. The first two are similar to our Sun and orbit each other, while Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf and the closest of the three to Earth. Proxima even has at least one planet that may lie in the habitable zone!</p>

            <h2>Sirius</h2>
            <img src="Images-Stars/Sirius.jpg.webp" alt="Sirius">
            <p>sirius could refer to different things depending on the context, but generally, it likely relates to Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, often called the "Dog Star." It’s part of the constellation Canis Major and has been important in astronomy, mythology, and navigation throughout history.</p>

            <h2>Arcturus</h2>
            <img src="Images-Stars/Arcturus-01w.jpg" alt="Arcturus">
            <p>Arcturus is the brightest star in the constellation Bootes and the fourth-brightest star in the night sky. It's an orange giant, located about 36.7 light-years from Earth. Arcturus is notable for its brightness and distinctive orange hue, caused by its cooler surface temperature compared to the Sun. It's also moving rapidly through space and has been a key navigational star for centuries.</p>

            <h2>Betelgeuse</h2>
            <img src="Images-Stars/6ZeJhkuqkud68ngfVZQEVe.jpg" alt="Betelgeuse">
            <p>Betelgeuse is a massive red supergiant star located in the constellation Orion, about 642 light-years from Earth. It’s one of the brightest stars in the night sky and easily visible as Orion’s “shoulder.” Betelgeuse is nearing the end of its life and will eventually explode as a supernova, making it one of the most studied stars in astronomy. Its size is enormous—if it replaced our Sun, it would extend past the orbit of Jupiter!</p>
